# So far, the way this seems to work is by having an event loop somewhere in client,
# which constantly listens for events, and invokes callback functions pertaining to the event when one is registered.
# (in the background).

# The await key calls asynchronous functions (i.e. everything in discord.py).
# When python encounters an 'await' call, within a function, it will stop the parent function execution there,
# and do other work until it's ready to continue working on that function (once the await-called thing is done,
# probably). So we can do some parallel work in an easy way.
