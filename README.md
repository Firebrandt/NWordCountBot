NWordCountBot is a discord application made to detect and count usages of the N-Word (in its various forms) in a discord server it's added to.
The addition of the bot can be done by putting the following link in chat (requires manage server permission): 
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=875784190182973541&permissions=8&scope=bot.

That will spawn the bot with the permissions it uses, more or less.

The bot uses the prefix N_ to recognize commands given to it via chat.
N_help provides a reference for the commands.

I don't actually have a server for this bot so it may not be online all the time, be advised.
